# Threat Hunting Sigma rules

I love Sigma; it's amazing for sharing detection rules. Although, I thought that it could also be used to share Threat Hunting query logic.

I've created this section to start sharing TH-focused sigma rules. They may have a wider scope as opposed to detection rules and thus, TH-focused sigma rules might also need tuning before they turn into a detection. I hope this effort will help people start looking at the big picture when hunting and start baselining their environment based on the query results.
